The file appears to be missing a closing curly brace `}` at the very end. Here's the corrected version with the missing closing brace added:

```typescript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
// ... [rest of the imports]

const JournalPage: React.FC = () => {
  // ... [rest of the component code]
};

export default JournalPage;
}
```

The file needed one additional closing curly brace to properly close the module scope. All other brackets and parentheses in the file appear to be properly matched.
